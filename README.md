A dog in a living room laying on a shaggy carpet. The dog is a pug dog laying on it's back on a shaggy carpet in a quaint small living room. The dog rolls over and sits up then quickly looks at the camera. The dog begins to speak "Hi! Does this new V A E look better? Does it?" the dogs mouth moving as it talks. It then laughs and let's out a giant extremely loud fart.
